    REST with ASP.NET Core WebAPI for:

    - Integration with other platforms

    - Expose data to be consumed via Mobile application

    - Create a back-end to be consumed with a SPA model application

    - Work in the Microservices model
 
 
ASP.NET Core Project

    1. Clean Architecture: Consider adopting a clean architecture to clearly separate responsibilities into layers such as domain, application, infrastructure, and user interface. This will facilitate application maintenance and testing.

    2. RESTful standards: Design your API following RESTful principles to ensure a consistent and intuitive interface for customers.

    3. Security: Implement proper authentication and authorization to protect your API from unauthorized access. Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

    4. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Use Entity Framework Core to map domain objects to database tables, simplifying interaction with the SQL Server database.

Angular Project

    1. Reusable Modules and Components: Divide your application into reusable modules and components to promote maintainability and scalability.

    2. HTTP Services: Use the HttpClient service to make calls to your RESTful API from your Angular application. Consider creating separate services to encapsulate data access logic.

    3. Routing: Configure Angular routing to navigate between different parts of the application efficiently.

Integration and Good Practices

    1. API Documentation: Use tools like Swagger to document your API, making it easier for developers to understand and consume.

    2. Monitoring and Logging: Implement appropriate logging in your application to record important events and monitor the performance of your application.

    3. Error Management: Handle errors appropriately on both the server and client sides to provide a consistent and user-friendly user experience.

    4. Coding Standards: Follow the recommended coding standards for both technologies (C#/.NET and TypeScript/Angular) to ensure clean and maintainable code.
